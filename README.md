<h2 align="center">Summary</h2>
 

**Reconator** is a Framework for automating your process of reconnaisance without any Computing resource (Systemless Recon) at free of cost. Its Purely designed to host on Heroku which is a free cloud hosting provider. It performs the work of enumerations along with many vulnerability checks and obtains maximum information about the target domain.       

It also performs various vulnerability checks like XSS, Open Redirects, SSRF, CRLF, LFI, SQLi and much more. Along with these, it performs OSINT, fuzzing, dorking, ports scanning, nuclei scan on your target.

Reconator receives all the targets needs to be reconed via a Web Interface and adds into the Queue and Notifies via Telebot on start and end of Recon on a target. So this is 100% automated and don't require any manual interaction
